                <h2>1. Understand the Basics of Graph Theory</h2>
                <p>
                    Before diving into DFS and BFS, it's essential to understand the fundamentals of graph theory. Learn
                    about nodes, edges, adjacency lists, and adjacency matrices.

                <h2>2. Learn the Concept of Recursion</h2>
                <p>
                    Depth-First Search (DFS) is heavily dependent on recursion. Make sure you have a solid understanding
                    of recursion and how the call stack works.

                <h2>3. Understand the Difference Between DFS and BFS</h2>
                <p>
                    BFS explores all nodes at the present "depth" level before moving on to nodes at the next depth
                    level, while DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

                <h2>4. Learn Depth-First Search (DFS)</h2>
                <p>
                    Study the DFS algorithm, its implementation, and its use cases. Practice coding DFS for both
                    recursive and iterative approaches, and understand how backtracking is implemented.

                <h2>5. Learn Breadth-First Search (BFS)</h2>
                <p>
                    Learn how BFS uses a queue to explore nodes level by level. Understand BFS implementation, time
                    complexity, and common problems that can be solved using BFS.

                <p>
                    Use visual tools or coding playgrounds to see how DFS and BFS explore graphs. This can help build
                    intuition on how these algorithms navigate nodes and edges.

                <p>
                    Practice solving graph-related problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codeforces.
                    Start with basic problems and gradually move to more complex ones involving DFS and BFS.

                    Explore more advanced topics like finding connected components, cycle detection, shortest paths
                    (using BFS), and topological sorting (using DFS).

                <p>
                    Apply DFS and BFS in real-world projects or scenarios, such as maze solving, social network
                    analysis, or web crawling. Building projects will enhance your understanding and solidify your
                    skills.
