      <h1>About Our Project</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to our Graph Traversal Project! This project focuses on implementing Depth-First Search (DFS) and
        Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms for graph traversal. These algorithms play a crucial role in various
        applications like pathfinding, network analysis, and AI search strategies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our backend features user authentication functionality, providing a Login and Signup page for a secure and
        personalized experience. Whether you are a student learning graph theory or a professional looking to understand
        advanced search algorithms, our platform offers a comprehensive solution for understanding these traversal
        techniques.
